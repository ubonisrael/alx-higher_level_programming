# 0x0F-python-object_relational_mapping

In this project, you will link two amazing worlds: Databases and Python!

- In the first part, you will use the module MySQLdb to connect to a MySQL database and execute your SQL queries.

- In the second part, you will use the module SQLAlchemy (don’t ask me how to pronounce it…) an Object Relational Mapper (ORM).
